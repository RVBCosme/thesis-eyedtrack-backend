# EyeDTrack Backend

Backend server for **EyeDTrack**, a real-time driver attention monitoring system designed to enhance road safety by detecting driver drowsiness and inattentiveness.

---

## Overview  
This backend processes real-time video input to analyze driver attention using computer vision and machine learning.  
It communicates with the Kotlin-based mobile frontend through REST APIs and performs inference using LLAVA and Haar Cascade models.

## Installation  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RVBCosme/thesis-eyedtrack-backend.git
cd eyedtrack-backend

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
py -3.11 main.py
```

## Configuration
To change API call targets, update the backend integration URL in your configuration file:
```bash
# Path: config.yaml
integration:
  base_url: "http://<your-private-IP-address>"
  allowed_hosts: ["localhost", "127.0.0.1", "10.0.2.2", "0.0.0.0", "*", "your-private-IP-address"]
```

**Tip**: Your private IP address will be displayed in the terminal when you run the server.
